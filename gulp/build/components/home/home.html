    <h1>WHAT'S AI?</h1>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        AI is short for Artificial Intelligence which the OED defines as “computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception,
        speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.” As of 2018, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN’s) – a state of the art modeling technique that loosely
        mimics how the human brain functions – are the gold standard in Artificial Intelligence research.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the one hand, Artificial Neural Networks or Deep Learning is not a new concept. The basic architecture for the modern ANN was first published posthumously by John von Neumann
        in the seminal paper <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Computer_and_the_Brain"><span>The Computer and the Brain</span></a>. On the other hand, AI is a subset of the field of Machine Learning that changes everything we think we
            know about computer programming.

            You may be asking, if they’ve been around since Nixon was in office, why is

        to $1.2 trillion by 2020? How rediculous is the leading
        <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/607970/experts-predict-when-artificial-intelligence-will-exceed-human-performance/">AI Experts at MIT’s prediction</a>
        that there’s a “50 percent chance that AI will be better than humans at more or less everything in about 45 years” with full automation of all human jobs in roughly 125 years?
        What would that even look like? All good questions. In my opinion, there some of the most important questions facing the human race today? Sounds hyperbolic...I know...
        but when Elon Musk (CEO of Tesla, Space X, and Solar City) says, “With AI, we’re summoning the Devil” and Stephen Hawking (genius) paints a picture of AI figuring out
        “faster than light speed travel” and solving <span class="strike-through">string theory</span> “the grand unified theory of Physics” 1,000 years sooner than expected,
        it’s probably a good time to start asking a few more questions...We’ll even answer a few of them below ;)
    </p>
    <p>
        Neural Networks made a resurgence in the mid 2000’s, because of something called Moore’s Law (read *strike through Moore’s Law* one man’s a prediction that computing power
        will double every 4 years as we figure out how to make hardware smaller which has held true since the day he made it). Neural Networks need a substantial amount of computing
        power before they begin to yield accurate results. Once they get that power though, we’re not really sure exactly what they’re capable of. In the past decade, they brought to
        life things previously reserved for science fiction: self driving cars, virtual assistants like Alexa and Siri, many of the chat bots that message you on websites, speech
        recognition. They can even compose music and ...
    </p>
    <p>
        The most important thing to understand about Neural Networks, AI, and Machine Learning in general is that human being don’t actually tell these “programs” what to do.
        In traditional programming, the kind that’s been running your Laptop since childhood and powers the apps on your mobile phone, a human being tell the computer what to do
        using a series of sequential commands: “if the user clicks the “send button” trigger the TCIP protocol that sends the packet of information that is your email to your
        boss's inbox”. That looks something like this:
    </p>
    <div class="wrap">
        <div class="itgm-code-block">
            <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
<code class="language-javascript">// Example of how traditional programming sends an e-mail
function sendEmail(email_content, target_email_address) {
    // If the user clicks the “Send Button”
    if(send_button.isClicked()) {
        // Route “Email Content” to the e-mail address in the “Send To” field
        email_content.sendTo(target_email_address);
    }
}();</code></pre>
        </div>
</div>
    <p>
    <br/>
        What does this mean? Well, it means that a human being is fully in control of a computer programs every about. If the GMail sends an email intended for you girlfriend to the CEO of
        your company, it’s because someone told the program to do exactly that under a specific set of circumstances that you just triggered. It means that computer programs literally aren’t
        capable of doing something that a human being didn’t tell them to do. Sure, things get a lot more complicated when there’s 1,000,000 lines of code to sort through, but the
        fundamental principle always holds true. Traditional Software is only capable of doing what it’s told.

        Artificial Intelligence, Neural Networks, Deep Learning, and Supervised Learning are all examples of Machine Learning - a fundamentally different kind of computer programming -
        where none of those old rules exist.
    </p>
    <p>
        Have you ever heard someone - probably a programmer - say something like, “Self Driving cars will never be better than human beings at driving, because they never be as fast or as
        good as human beings at processing the kind of complex rules required to make the hard, life or death decisions such as, “do I hit this school bus full of nuns or run over a 18 month
        old baby?” Seen a movie where an eccentric genius hard codes a self-aware Android with an Azimof Prime directive...some sort of “core programming” that can’t be overwritten, rendering
        the android incapable of hurting a human being?
    </p>
    <p>
        These statements represent a fundamental misunderstand about what Artificial Intelligence really is. If interpreted literally - at face value - they don’t really make any sense.
        Why? Because they presuppose the same fundamental rules that have been in place since the dawn computer science. The problem is, those rules don’t apply in the word of Machine
        Learning and AI.
    </p>
    <p>
        Human Beings don’t tell a Neural Network what to do. It’s impossible. The interface for doing so doesn’t exist. Human Beings train Neural Network - teach them - like we would a
        child or a student.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, what? They have a mind of their own? Well...honestly...no one knows. Anyone that tells you they do know is either lying or doesn’t know what they’re talking about.
    </p>
    <p>
        I think it’s important for you to make up your own mind. To do that, you need to understand what a Neural Network is. The Architecture diagrams look scary and the movies make it
        sound like AI is reserved for Stephen Hawking or Einstein, but they underlying concepts are rather simple and (with analysts estimating that ...) learning about them has tangible
        career benefits beyond being able to make informed decisions about the future of the human race.
